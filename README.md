### Instructions

Regarding our game, you just need to run it in its entirety and follow the displayed instructions (i.e., when you have a choice, for example: 
1. Male 2. Female, you just need to enter a number between 1 and 2, the same goes for letters; with a slight exception for the name you will enter, where you just need to write a name).

In case the game ends (either because your character has died, you've decided to exit the adventure, or your character reaches level 10), you simply need to restart the program from the beginning.

To make the most of the expansions, it's advisable when creating your character to choose a wizard, which will allow you to access spells during battles later on.
